## Course Notes

Following sections summarize the important notes taken during the framework development.

### Part 1 - Automate Test Cases using TestNG and go through Bad Practices

* Appium Java Client will also download the Selenium Libraries as dependent libraries.

> Important! Please create all packages and class files in src/test/java and not in src/main/java. Recently, Appium has
> changed ths scope of one of its transitive Selenium dependency (Support UI package) from "compile" to "runtime". Due
> to
> this, the dependency may not resolve under src/main/java. We can certainly try to change the scope to compile, but
> lets
> be safe and create everything under src/test/java. This is where typically test automation resides. if you still want
> to
> use src/main/java, then please add the entire "selenium-java" package as a separate dependency in pom.xml. make sure
> to
> match the version with the selenium version that is shipped with the Appium Java client.

> For iOS real devices, remember you cannot use the IPA from the download location of application directly. You will
> need to get the source code, then go through the code signing process to generate the IPA. You can follow the iOS real
> device setup videos for the code signing process.

* Code Duplication:
    * Username and password steps are being repeatedly used in each test case.
    * Distribute the element definition globally and reuse in each test case.
* Readability:
    * code for performing login is not readable.
* Hardcoding - Test Data
    * username and password are being hardcoded in the test cases.
    * We should add abstraction between the test data and the code.
    * So change of test data will not impact test cases, and multiple tests can be ran from using same test data.
* Hardcoding - Static text
    * The error messages and hard coded which should also be abstracted away and read from external JSON/XML file.
* Scalability Issue
    * Driver initialization is confined to only single class, and cannot be reused.
    * Moreover, the capabilities should also be read from external file or through commandline.
* Waits
    * Implicit wait is not a good practice.
    * Use explicit wait and manage all the waits from single place.
* Multiple platform support
    * Test cases should be designed to support both iOS and Android platforms with minor changes.
    * Driver should be initialized for the corresponding platform based on test cases.
* Logging
    * Logging framework should be used instead of printing information on console.
    * In case of parallel execution, separate logs for each device should be used.
* Reporting
    * Reporting libraries should be used to create visually appealing report with screenshots and videos
* Exception Handling
    * Exceptions should be handled and printed to logs
* Configuration
    * Appium server urls and ports should be derived from config properties files

* Design the framework to achieve scalability, maintainability, abstraction, parameterization, robust logging and
  reporting,

### Part 2 - Implement Page Object Model (POM) design

<img src="doc/framework-structure.png" width="1200">

* Page Classes are added and extended from the BaseTest to reuse the methods and specify locators inside page classes.
* We achieved following objectives so far:
    * Avoid code duplication by reusing the elements.
    * Improve code readability by adding actions methods for login in page.
    * Scalable Automation by initializing the driver at BaseTest.
    * Wait and Driver commands handling at single place i.e. BaseTest super class
    * Modular and Independent test cases
    * Parameterization of global properties through config.properties and testng parameters for device.
        * All the parameters defined at test level will also be available to nested classes and methods in testng.xml
        * If the parameters are provided at test level and driver is initialized at class level, it will work for
          sequential execution.
        * But if you run the test classes in parallel, then it will try to install the same application parallel to all
          the test classes because we are providing the same parameters to all the test classes.
        *

* Inheritance approach has some disadvantages like one can create methods in child classes which will override the
  methods in
  parent class, or declare the elements inside Test Class instead of Pages which is not a good practice.
*

### Part 3 - Alternate Design | Abstract Test Data & Static Text | Exception Handling
* This lecture will discuss:

#### Alternate Design (no Inheritance)
    
* Go to the git branch `part3/alternate-design` to see the source code for this part.
* This time we initialize the driver in test class itself with @BeforeClass annotated method which means that driver
  will be initialized separately for each of the test class.
* This is fine for sequential execution, but not for parallel runs because of the thread conflicts and also the same app
  cannot be installed on same device for each class simultaneously. For this, we need multiple devices.

#### Exception Handling (Try/Catch, TestNG Listener)

* This TestListener which implements ITestListener will print the entire stacktrace to console and also to the testng results if error occurs:
* This way we do not have to use try-catch block for each step and use it in a generic manner to catch all the  exceptions.
```java
    @Override
    public void onTestFailure(ITestResult result) {
        //This will help to get the error stack trace to testng results to read the error cause
        //Check if there is an exception thrown by test result
        if (result.getThrowable() != null) {
            StringWriter sw = new StringWriter();
            PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(sw);
            result.getThrowable().printStackTrace(pw);  //prints the entire stacktrace to testng results
            System.out.println(sw.toString());  //prints the stacktrace to console
        }
    }
```

#### Add Abstraction Layer for Test Data

* We will use the `json` library from `org.json` to parse the Json for login user data.
* [JSON In Java Â» 20230618](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json/20230618)

```java
    try {
        loginDetails = getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("data/loginUsers.json");
        JSONTokener tokener = new JSONTokener(loginDetails);
        loginUsersObject = new JSONObject(tokener);

        if (loginDetails != null) {
            loginDetails.close();
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        System.out.println("Failed to load the test user data from " + Constants.dataFileName);
    }
```

* and then simply read the desired data e.g. 
* `loginUsersObject.getJSONObject("invalidUser").getString("username")`

#### Add Abstraction Layer for Static Text

* We place the strings in `strings.xml` file. Normally we get this file from android developers who also use the
  Strings.xml for storing strings, this way we do not have to create them separately for automation.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <!-- Error Text -->
    <string name="err_invalid_username_or_password">Username and password do not match any user in this service.</string>
    <string name="product_title">PRODUCTS</string>
</resources>
```
* We will use the `DocumentBuilderFactory` to read the xml.
```java
public HashMap<String, String> parseStringXML(InputStream file) throws Exception{
        HashMap<String, String> stringMap = new HashMap<String, String>();
        //Get Document Builder
        DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
        DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();

        //Build Document
        Document document = builder.parse(file);

        //Normalize the XML Structure; It's just too important !!
        document.getDocumentElement().normalize();

        //Here comes the root node
        Element root = document.getDocumentElement();

        //Get all elements
        NodeList nList = document.getElementsByTagName("string");

        for (int temp = 0; temp < nList.getLength(); temp++)
        {
            Node node = nList.item(temp);
            if (node.getNodeType() == Node.ELEMENT_NODE)
            {
                Element eElement = (Element) node;
                // Store each element key value in map
                stringMap.put(eElement.getAttribute("name"), eElement.getTextContent());
            }
        }
        return stringMap;
    }
```
* And then we can simply read it by parsing the XML stream as InputStream and storing it into HashMap.
*
